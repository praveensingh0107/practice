/**
 * You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2, A3 â€¦ AN-1}. There are K painters available and you are also given how much time a painter takes to paint 1 unit of board. You have to get this job done as soon as possible under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board.
 *
 * 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board
 * cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
 * A painter will only paint contiguous boards. Which means a
 * configuration where painter 1 paints board 1 and 3 but not 2 is
 * invalid.
 * Return the ans % 10000003
 *
 * Input :
 * K : Number of painters
 * T : Time taken by painter to paint 1 unit of board
 * L : A List which will represent length of each board
 *
 * Output:
 *      return minimum time to paint all boards % 10000003
 * Example
 *
 * Input :
 *   K : 2
 *   T : 5
 *   L : [1, 10]
 * Output : 50
